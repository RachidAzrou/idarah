Build the page background and fullscreen scaling for the Digital Membership Card so the card visually “pops” on a dark stage. Keep the existing card component; focus on the canvas/layout around it. Locale nl-BE, PWA-friendly, accessible.

Tech

Next.js 14 (App Router) + React 18 + TypeScript strict

TailwindCSS (utilities only)

Optional tiny CSS module for background layers (no heavy libs)

Files to create

app/card/[memberId]/page.tsx — route that renders the canvas + card.

components/card/CardCanvas.tsx — background + centering + scaling logic.

components/card/FullScreenButton.tsx — optional desktop fullscreen toggle.

styles/card-canvas.css — background layers (spotlight, vignette, sheen, grain).

Ensure <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">.

Visual direction — Dark stage, card as the hero

Base background: deep navy to ink blue radial gradient (center slightly above the card):

Colors (suggestion): #0B1220 → #0E264A → #0B1220.

Vignette: subtle radial darkening at edges (40–60% opacity gradient) for focus.

Sheen: faint diagonal linear gradient (135°) to add a glossy “studio light” feel (very low opacity).

Grain/noise: ultra-fine texture at 3–5% opacity to prevent banding.

Optional rim-light behind the card: a soft blurred ellipse (rgba(37, 99, 235, 0.20)) to separate the card from the background (blue that matches your brand).

No heavy blurs; keep GPU-friendly.

Layout & scaling — Card must fill the screen without blurring

Keep credit-card aspect ratio ~ 1.586:1 (aspect-[1586/1000]).

Use container sizing (width/height) not CSS transform: scale() (prevents text blur).

Rules:

Portrait phones: w-[min(92vw,70vh*1.586)] centered.

Landscape (phones/tablets): h-[min(94vh,94vw/1.586)].

Desktop: w-[clamp(560px, 70vmin, 880px)].

iOS safe areas: outer padding with env(safe-area-inset-*).

Place <MembershipCard className="h-full w-full" /> inside the aspect box.

Accessibility & motion

Respect prefers-reduced-motion: disable any idle shimmer on background.

Fullscreen button (F hotkey on desktop) with aria-label="Volledig scherm".

Maintain AA contrast; focus-visible rings on interactive elements.

Implementation details (Tailwind + CSS)

CardCanvas.tsx wrapper:

relative min-h-screen w-full overflow-hidden

padding: px-[max(env(safe-area-inset-left),16px)] py-[max(env(safe-area-inset-top),16px)]

include classes from card-canvas.css for:

.bg-spotlight (radial center light)

.bg-vignette (dark edges)

.bg-sheen (faint diagonal light)

.bg-grain (noise overlay)

.bg-rimlight (blurred ellipse behind card)

Centering:

grid place-items-center

Aspect box:

mx-auto aspect-[1586/1000] w-full with responsive width/height utilities above.

Acceptance criteria

Background is dark, premium, with spotlight/vignette/sheen that makes the card pop.

Card fills as much of the viewport as possible (portrait/landscape/desktop) without text blur.

Optional rim-light creates separation; respects reduced motion.

Safe for PWA standalone (viewport-fit=cover), accessible controls.
